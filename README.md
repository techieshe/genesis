genesis
=======

These are the hooks that I use for customizing child themes under the genesis framework.

I am new to Github and I am not even sure what I am doing here (except to put all the codes that I use in one place).

If you follow me, thank you! You can also visit me at my blog at http://techieshe.com. It's my "techie-wanna-be"
and "frustrated designer" playground. LOL!

Have a nice one!
